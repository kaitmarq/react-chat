Building a Real-time Chat App with React, Node.Js and Firebase

**Source**
This project was built following a blog post by Timonwa Akintokun, linked here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-reactjs-and-firebase/
The purpose of the project was to become more familiar with React, node.js, and firebase for future projects, such as my Caterpillar Info Session!
Her tutorial acts as the skeleton, which I built upon and modified further. This version of the react chat features different UI and the ability to send JPEG images and GIF files on top of text messages.
